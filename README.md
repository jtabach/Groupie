# Group Fantasy Football League

Social media platform for fantasy football. Talk fantasy football with your friends, track your team and player stats, and stay up to date with player news.

## Motivation

The current fantasy football ecosystem requires players to use mulitple platforms to keep up with their team (espn/yahoo/nfl), players news (rotoworld/rotowire), and friends (facebook/instagram). Group Fantasy Football League is intended to bring all of that together on a single platform where they can be notified of updates to their timeline, teams, and news.
